## Object Oriented Programming Goals

- The main actor of in OOP is **Object** which is an istance of a **Class**.

- Class is like a real world classes like Car, which is all cars around the world despise it is four x four, hybird, electrical, hatchback cars, and so on all of them are instancess from the same **Class** which is car, tesla is an instance from that class which has its aspects and features.

- Software implementations should achieve robustness, adaptability, and reusability.

    - **Robustness**: a program produces the right output for all the anticipated inputs in the programâ€™s application. In addition, we want software to be robust, that is, capable of handling unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined for its application.
        - For example, if a program is expecting a positive integer (perhaps representing the price of an item) and instead is given a negative integer,then the program should be able to recover gracefully from this error.

    - **Portability**, which is the ability of software to run with minimal change on different hardware and operating system platforms. 

    - **Reusability**: the same code should be usable as a component of different systems in various applications.

    - In Python, every piece of data is represented as an instance of some class
