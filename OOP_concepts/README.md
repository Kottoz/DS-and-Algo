## Object Oriented Programming Goals

- The main actor of in OOP is **Object** which is an istance of a **Class**.

- Class is like a real world classes like Car, which is all cars around the world despise it is four x four, hybird, electrical, hatchback cars, and so on all of them are instancess from the same **Class** which is car, tesla is an instance from that class which has its aspects and features.

- Software implementations should achieve robustness, adaptability, and reusability.

    - **Robustness**: a program produces the right output for all the anticipated inputs in the programâ€™s application. In addition, we want software to be robust, that is, capable of handling unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined for its application.
        - For example, if a program is expecting a positive integer (perhaps representing the price of an item) and instead is given a negative integer,then the program should be able to recover gracefully from this error.

    - **Portability**, which is the ability of software to run with minimal change on different hardware and operating system platforms. 

    - **Reusability**: the same code should be usable as a component of different systems in various applications.


## Object Oriented Programming Design Principles
- [Modularity](#modularity)
- [Abstraction](#abstraction)
- [Encapsulation](#ancapsulation)

### Modularity

- **Modularity** refers to an organizing principle in which different components of a software system are divided into separate functional units.
- Using modularity to bring a clarity of thought that provides a natural way of organizing functions into distinct manageable units.
- In Python, we have already seen that a module is a collection of closely related functions and classes that are defined together in a single file of source code. 
- The use of modularity helps support the goals. Robustness is greatly increased because it is easier to test and debug separate components
before they are integrated into a larger software system.
- bugs that persist in a complete system might be traced to a particular component, which can be fixed in relative isolation. The structure imposed by modularity also helps enable software reusability.
- If software modules are written in a general way, the modules can be reused when related need arises in other contexts.

### Abstraction

- **Abstraction** Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on how to use the application.
- An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class.
- An ADT specifies what each operation does, but not how it does it.
- Look at Abstraction examble in notebook.

    - In Python, every piece of data is represented as an instance of some class
